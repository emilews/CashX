## Notice

This project (and therefore this readme) is still in development, so it's all subject to change.

## What is CashX?

CashX is a safe, private and decentralized way to exchange bitcoin for national currencies and other digital assets. CashX uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a third party. CashX is non-custodial and incorporates a human arbitration system to resolve disputes.

To learn more, see the doc and video at https://bisq.network/intro.

This project is a fork of Bisq, so almost everything can be learnt from their documentation.
